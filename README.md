Unable to connect to SMTP server: The server might be down, or you entered it incorrectly. If you do not know your smtp server, look up the name of your email domain (ex. gmail) followed by "smtp server address". it will usually look something like this: smtp.domain.com
Server disconnected unexpectedly: Ensure that you have a stable internet connection, and the the server you are trying to access isn't down
